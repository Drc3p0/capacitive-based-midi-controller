/*********************************************************
This is a library for the MPR121 12-channel Capacitive touch sensor

Designed specifically to work with the MPR121 Breakout in the Adafruit shop 
  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/

These sensors use I2C communicate, at least 2 pins are required 
to interface
